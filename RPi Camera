`libcamera-jpeg -o test.jpg -t 2000 --width 400 --height 400 --roi 0.25,0.25,0.12,0.12`
This command utilizes the `libcamera-jpeg` tool for camera control and image capture, specifically in JPEG format. It employs multiple options to configure attributes of the captured image.

- `-o test.jpg`: Sets the output file name for the captured image to "test.jpg."
- `-t 2000`: Specifies the time (in milliseconds) before stopping the capture after the camera starts. In this instance, the capture continues for 2000 milliseconds (i.e., 2 seconds).
- `--width 400`: Configures the width of the captured image to be 400 pixels.
- `--height 400`: Configures the height of the captured image to be 400 pixels.
- `--roi 0.25,0.25,0.12,0.12`: Defines the Region of Interest (ROI). In this case, a rectangular area starting from the center of the image, with a width and height of 25% and 12% of the entire image, respectively, is specified.

This command captures an image through the camera and saves it in JPEG format with the filename "test.jpg." The capture duration is set to 2 seconds, and the captured image has dimensions of 400x400 pixels. A specific Region of Interest, corresponding to 25% x 12% of the entire image and centered in the image, is defined.
